                            In short, we recommend auctioning off your NFT and selecting one of our partnered charities at the time of minting. Most nonprofits aren’t set up to accept an NFT donation directly due to the tax complications with the valuation, before the auction is done. Donating the auction proceeds in crypto is the next best option!</div>

                        <h4>Terms & Conditions</h4>
                        This Terms of Use is a legal agreement between you (referred to herein as "the User", “you” or "your")
                        and Artemis Vision Platform (referred to herein as “the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”).</p>
                        <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                        <p>This Terms of Use is a legal agreement between you (referred to herein as "the User", “you” or
                        "your") and Artemis Vision Platform (referred to herein as “the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), the company
                        who owns and operates the Platform and the Site (defined below).
                        By using the Platform and the Site, you accept and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use, the
                        Privacy Policy, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance
                        with any applicable local laws. Please read the Privacy Policy to find out how we collect, use, disclose,
                        process and protect your personal data. For avoidance of doubt, any and all terms, conditions, licences,
                        limitations, and obligations contained within and on the Site are incorporated into these Terms of Use
                        by reference. In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and any other pages or
                        policies on the Site, these Terms of Use shall prevail.
                        The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
                        entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
                        regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
                        Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own
                        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are
                        applicable.
                        You agree that by using the Platform, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by
                        these Terms of Use. If you do not agree with these Terms of Use, then you are expressly prohibited from
                        using the Site and you must discontinue use immediately.
                        It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Use to stay informed of updates. You
                        will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in
                        any revised Terms and Conditions by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised Terms
                        and Conditions are posted.
                        For the convenience of the users, all content on this Site may be available in multiple languages. In
                        case of any conflict between different language versions of such content or any omission in any
                        language version, the English version of such content shall prevail.
                        Where the Company has published a document that is referred to within these Terms (such as a
                        policy document), that document shall also form part of these Terms and shall be deemed to have been 
                        agreed to by you. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and a document referenced within
                        them, these Terms shall prevail.</p>

                        ● Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of tokens associated with the wallet.</p>
                        <p>Token transactions</p>
                        <p>In order to be completed, all proposed token transactions (including but not limited to NFT creation,
                        transactions, token withdrawal) must be confirmed and recorded in the corresponding public
                        blockchain. By using the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit
                        may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by that public blockchain network.
                        Once transaction details have been submitted via the Platform, we cannot assist you to cancel or
                        otherwise modify your transaction. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your wallet
                        and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction.</p>
                        <p>Attack on blockchain networks</p>
                        <p>The Company cannot prevent or mitigate attacks on blockchain networks and has no obligation to
                        engage in activity in relation to such attacks. In the event of an attack, the Company reserves the right to
                        take commercially reasonable actions, including, but not limited to, if we confirm that a network is
                        compromised or under attack, immediately halting the platform for such network. Resolutions will be
                        determined on a case-by-case basis by the Company in its sole discretion. The Company makes no 
                        representation and does not warrant the safety of the Platform and you assume all liability for any lost
                        value or stolen property.</p>
                        <p>Software protocols and operational challenges</p>
                        <p>The software protocols that underlie tokens are typically open-source projects, which means that (i) the
                        development and control of such tokens are outside of the Company’s control and (ii) such software
                        protocols are subject to sudden and dramatic changes that might have a significant impact on the
                        availability, usability or value of a given token.
                        You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. The Company may experience
                        sophisticated cyber attacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties
                        that may cause interruptions to the Platform and the Site. You understand that the Platform and the Site
                        may experience operational issues that lead to delays. You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure
                        resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from
                        sophisticated attacks. You agree not to hold the Company accountable for any related losses.
                        All users understand that the technology underlying tokens is subject to change at any time, and such
                        changes may affect the Platform. You claim full responsibility for monitoring such technological changes
                        and understanding their consequences for your tokens. The Company does not take any responsibility
                        for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of the Platform or your failure to understand the
                        risks involved associated with tokens use generally or your use of our Services</p>
                        <p>Legislative and regulatory changes</p>
                        <p>Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the domestic or international level may adversely affect
                        the transfer of tokens.</p>
                        <p>Other risks</p>
                        <p>You understand and agree that the Company has no control over, and no duty to take any action

                        ● Technical failures in the hardware of the user of any token-related software or service, e.g., data
                        loss due to a faulty or damaged storage device<br />
                        ● Security problems experienced by the user of any token-related software or service, e.g.,

                            So that we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase
                            “Personal Information” in this Policy, we mean information about an individual that (either by
                            itself or when combined with information from other available sources) allows that individual
                            to be identified, including but not limited, the individual’s name, telephone number, or e-mail
                            address.</p>
                            <p>The Blockchains</p>
                            <p>Due to the inherent transparency of many blockchains, transactions that individuals broadcast
                            via any blockchain may be publicly accessible. This includes, but is not limited to, your public
                            sending address, the public address of the receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other
                            data a user has chosen to include in a given transaction. Information stored on a blockchain
                            may be public, immutable, and difficult or even impossible to remove or delete. Transactions
                            and addresses may reveal information about the user’s identity and information can potentially
                            be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law
                            enforcement. Users are encouraged to review how privacy and transparency on the blockchain
                            works.</p>
